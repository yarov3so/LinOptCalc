Welcome to LinOptCalc!

LinOptCalc is an informative and easy-to-use tool meant to help you master the simplex method for linear optimization. It provides a step-by-step solution to any linear optimization problem you can think of, along with relevant descriptions useful in interpreting the result. 

You may choose to run the code within a Python interpreter by downloading 'LinOptCalc.zip' and running 'LinOptCalc.py', or, alternatively, you may download the macOS intel/arm64 binaries provided in their respective folders. Should you choose the former option, please note that you need to keep all the supporting .py files in the same directory as 'LinOptCalc.py'.

DISCLAIMER: 
I wrote this program about three/four weeks into following MIT's OpenCourseware Introduction to Python course. 
At that point in time, I had no knowledge of NumPy or any other mathematical libraries available in Python.
