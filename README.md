## Welcome to LinOptCalc!  

LinOptCalc is an informative and easy-to-use tool meant to help you master the simplex method for linear optimization. It provides a step-by-step solution to any linear optimization problem you can think of, along with relevant descriptions useful in interpreting the result. 

You may choose to run the code within a Python interpreter by downloading 'LinOptCalc_pyfiles.zip' and running 'LinOptCalc.py'.

*DISCLAIMER: 
I wrote this program about three/four weeks into following MIT's OpenCourseware Introduction to Python course. 
At that point in time, I had no knowledge of NumPy or any other mathematical libraries available in Python.*
